OpenStreetPad
=============

OpenStreetPad is an OpenStreetMap renderer based on MapCSS styles.  In it's current state it is integrated into an application that shows a single OSPMapView.  There are currently several bugs and shortcomings in OpenStreetPad, but they should be fixed pretty rapidly.

CoreParse
=========
To use OpenStreetPad, you must clone [CoreParse](http://www.github.com/beelsebob/CoreParse) into the same directory you clone OpenStreetPad into:

> git clone git://github.com/beelsebob/CoreParse.git
> 
> git clone git://github.com/beelsebob/OpenStreetPad.git

Once you've done this, open the OpenStreetPad and build the OpenStreetPad target.  You should not need to build any other target.
